# Hytale Server Patcher
This is a small project to apply certain patches to Hytale's game server. This is intended to solve things that can't be solved with normal plugins.

To use this; simply clone the project and build the JAR, then put it inside the server's `earlyplugins`-folder. You may want to consider running your server with the `--accept-early-plugins`-argument as well.

## Current Features
- Removes the `Player has left world` message entirely.
